# String-Operations

Aim : Program to perform the following string operations :
          (a) Split a string
          (b) Change uppercase to lower and lowercase to uppercase
          (c) Encryption / Decryption

Description : 
        Strings are defined as an array of characters. 
        The difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated with a special character ‘\0’.
        
        (a) To split the string , start reading the entire string character by character and find the element from where the 
            string needs to be split. As soon as the element is found, store it in separate variables and display.
        (b) Change case means to change uppercase alphabets(A to Z) to lowercase alphabets(a to z) and vice versa.
            To change case , string functions like toupper() and tolower() can be used.           
        (c) Encryption is the process of converting information or data into a code and decryption is the process of converting 
            the code into data.
